    "A study investigating generalized reciprocity in the dictator game revealed that individuals who received generosity tended to reciprocate generously, while those treated greedily reciprocated less favorably. The effect of the dictator's intention was significant: participants who received intentional generous offers behaved more generously towards others compared to those receiving intentional greedy offers. However, when offers were randomly given by a computer (unintentional), the previous treatment's nature had little relevance to participants' reciprocal behaviors. These results underscore the role of intentionality in promoting generalized reciprocity and encouraging positive social interactions. (Sun et al., 2020)"

Specifically, it elucidates how various psychological traits—such as friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, guilt, and certain dishonest behaviors—serve as adaptations regulating human altruistic behavior. The model posits that individuals possess both altruistic and cheating tendencies, with their expression influenced by developmental factors tailored to the local social and ecological environment.

This influence persisted over multiple periods and spread up to three degrees of separation. The study found that each additional contribution to the public good in the initial period was effectively tripled by subsequent contributions from others influenced by the initial act of cooperation. These findings demonstrate that cooperative behaviors can propagate significantly through social networks. (Fowler & Christakis, 2010)"

    "Altruism and egoism are two distinct motivational drivers for actions: altruistic actions aim to benefit others, while egoistic actions aim to benefit oneself. Strictly defined, an altruistic action loses its label if it provides any direct or indirect benefit to the actor, whereas psychological egoism asserts that all actions are inherently self-interested. This dichotomy often leads to conceptual misunderstandings. An alternative perspective suggests that the apparent dichotomy may result from committing motivational extremism on a conceptual level. It proposes that both altruism and egoism could originate from a single motivational source, manifesting in different actions based on context. (Kago & Venkataraman, 2023)"

Experimental evidence shows that strategic formation and dissolution of network links stabilize cooperation in large groups. Cooperation tends to decay over time in both randomly shuffled and permanently fixed networks. Infrequently updated networks also fail to maintain cooperation. However, when individuals frequently update their connections, they break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, maintaining high levels of cooperation and leading to significant network restructuring. These findings align with evolutionary game theoretic models and highlight the crucial role dynamic social networks play in sustaining large-scale human cooperation. (Rand et al., 2011)\n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "This study investigates the conditions under which a society initially dominated by self-centered individuals can evolve to adopt altruistic behavior as the norm. By examining the effects of factors such as the initial proportion of altruistic individuals, wealth distribution, and social network structure, we aim to understand the dynamics that facilitate the spread of altruism. Two types of networks are used: Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi, alongside mechanisms for wealth growth, trade, social influence, wealth redistribution by altruists, and employment changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Literature Insights\n",
    "Existing research offers several insights into how altruism and cooperation evolve within societies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Influence of Generosity and Selfishness**: Liu et al. (2015) found that individuals reciprocate generosity, reinforcing direct social influence, while selfish behavior exerts a stronger impact, affecting expectations about future interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Natural Selection and Psychological Traits**: Trivers (1971) provides a model explaining the natural selection of reciprocal altruism, illustrating how psychological traits such as trust, sympathy, and guilt help regulate altruistic behavior and suppress cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neurobiological Basis of Cooperation**: Rilling et al. (2002) demonstrated that mutual cooperation activates brain regions associated with reward processing, highlighting how these neural mechanisms reinforce reciprocal altruism.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evolutionarily Stable Strategies**: Axelrod & Hamilton (1981) showed that reciprocity-based cooperation can emerge and persist in an asocial environment through probabilistic interactions among individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cascade Effect of Cooperative Behavior**: Fowler & Christakis (2010) revealed that cooperative behavior can cascade through social networks, with contributions to the public good influencing subsequent acts of cooperation up to three degrees of separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dynamic Social Networks**: Rand et al. (2011) found that allowing individuals to frequently update their social connections leads to high levels of sustained cooperation, as cooperators establish links with each other and break ties with defectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Altruism and Egoism**: Kago & Venkataraman (2023) discussed the blurred lines between altruism and egoism, suggesting that both might stem from a common motivational source expressed differently depending on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "Our model includes the following components:\n",
    "- **Wealth Growth and Trade**: Agents participate in economic transactions that can increase their wealth.\n",
    "- **Social Influence**: Agent behavior is influenced by their neighbors in the network.\n",
    "- **Wealth Redistribution by Altruists**: Altruistic individuals redistribute part of their wealth to others.\n",
    "- **Employment Changes**: Agents can change their employment status, affecting their wealth and social influence.\n",
    "- **Social Network Structures**: We compare the effects of Barabasi-Albert (scale-free) and Erdos-Renyi (random) networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Norm changes occur when agents receive a donation, influencing their probability of becoming altruistic, and this change is further modulated by the behavior of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings and Discussion\n",
    "Based on the synthesis of the literature and our model's structure, the conditions leading to a predominantly altruistic society likely include:\n",
    "- High initial proportion of altruistic individuals to seed cooperative norms.\n",
    "- Wealth distributions that minimize extreme inequality, enabling altruists to make significant impressions through redistribution.\n",
    "- Social network structures that facilitate the rapid spread of norms, with the Barabasi-Albert network potentially being more favorable due to its hubs that accelerate norm propagation.\n",
    "- Regular updating of social connections to align altruists together, similar to the findings of Rand et al. (2011).\n",
    "- Positive reinforcement mechanisms, as indicated by Rilling et al. (2002), supporting cooperative behavior through socio-economic rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements collectively contribute to a tipping point where altruistic behavior becomes self-sustaining and spreads through the society, ultimately transforming a predominantly self-centered population into an altruistically dominant one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding the interplay of wealth distribution, social networks, and behavioral influence reveals crucial insights into fostering altruistic societies. By leveraging these dynamics, it is possible to encourage the adoption of altruistic norms, leading to more cooperative and mutually beneficial social systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "This study investigates the conditions under which a society initially dominated by self-centred individuals can evolve to adopt altruistic behaviour as the norm. Inspired by positive and normative economics concepts, we create an artificial economy initially characterized by egoism and explore how it can transition to one where altruism prevails. We examine factors such as the initial proportion of altruistic individuals, wealth distribution, and social network structures. Two network types are used: Barabasi-Albert, which likely simulates clusters of like-minded individuals, and Erdos-Renyi, which simulates small-world networks.  Some dynamics that are modelled include wealth growth, trade, social influence, wealth redistribution by altruists, and employment changes.
