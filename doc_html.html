<h1 id="from-egoism-to-altruism">From Egoism to Altruism</h1>
<p><strong>Palok (Paul) Biswas, Xiaojie Niu</strong></p>
<p>We investigate the conditions under which a society initially dominated by <em>selfish (egoist)</em> individuals can
    evolve to adopt <em>altruistic</em> behaviour as the norm. Inspired by <em>positive</em> and <em>normative</em>
    economics concepts, we create an artificial economy initially characterized by egoism and explore how it can
    transition to one where altruism prevails. We examine factors such as the <em>initial proportion of altruistic
        individuals</em>, <em>wealth distribution</em>, and <em>social network structures</em>. Two network types are
    used: <em>Barabasi-Albert</em>, which likely clusters of individuals, and Erdos-Renyi, which simulates small-world
    networks. Some modelled dynamics include <em>wealth growth,</em> <em>trade</em>, <em>social influence</em>,
    <em>wealth redistribution by altruists</em>, and <em>employment changes</em>. When approximately 80% of the
    population in a society adopts a new behavior, we consider that the society has effectively shifted to a new norm.

<h5 id="network-effects-and-social-influence">Network Effects and Social Influence</h5>
<p>Liu et al. (2015) demonstrated the direct social influence of generosity and selfishness, finding that while
    individuals reciprocate generosity, selfish behaviour tends to have a more substantial impact by shaping
    expectations about future interactions. Fowler and Christakis (2010) found that cooperative behaviour can cascade
    through social networks, influencing subsequent acts of cooperation up to three degrees of separation. Additionally,
    Rand et al. (2011) highlighted that dynamic social networks, where individuals frequently update their social
    connections, sustain high levels of cooperation by enabling cooperators to connect and disconnect from defectors.
    These findings suggest that network structure and social influence play crucial roles in propagating altruistic
    behaviours. This will inform our analysis of network dynamics in the Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi models.</p>
<h5 id="agents-reciprocate-if-benefited-by-altruism">Agents Reciprocate if Benefited by Altruism</h5>
<p>Trivers (1971) offered a model of reciprocal altruism, showing how psychological traits like trust, sympathy, and
    guilt regulate altruistic behaviour and deter cheating. In a neurobiological context, Rilling et al. (2002) showed
    that cooperation activates brain regions associated with rewards, reinforcing reciprocal altruism. Axelrod and
    Hamilton (1981) demonstrated through game theory and evolutionary models that reciprocity-based cooperation can
    persist as an evolutionarily stable strategy even in asocial environments. These insights emphasize that individuals
    are likely to continue altruistic behaviour if they perceive reciprocal benefits, highlighting the importance of
    psychological and neurobiological factors in facilitating the spread of altruism.</p>
<h5 id="egoism-and-altruism-may-originate-from-a-common-motivational-source">Egoism and Altruism May Originate from a
    Common Motivational Source</h5>
<p>Kago and Venkataraman (2023) discussed the blurred lines between altruism and egoism, suggesting that these
    behaviours may originate from a common motivational source but manifest differently based on context. These findings
    collectively inform our investigation into the transition from egoism to altruism, emphasizing the roles of social
    influence, network dynamics, psychological factors, and the potential for cascading behaviours and evolving stable
    strategies in fostering altruistic norms.</p>
<h2 id="key-modelling-assumptions">Key Modelling Assumptions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Wealth Generation</strong></strong>: Wealth grows at a fixed rate, emulating returns on
            investment. Salary is proportional to the initial wealth, and expenditure varies between a minimum and
            maximum expenditure per timestep.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Trade</strong></strong>: A fixed network structure is used throughout the simulation run. Two
            network structures are considered: Barabasi-Albert and Erdos-Renyi networks. Agents randomly select a
            neighbour for trade interactions, reflecting the stochastic nature of market interactions or social
            exchanges. Trading only occurs when the agent has a positive wealth. During the trade, agents transfer a
            predefined proportion of their wealth to the selected neighbour, simulating market transactions or resource
            sharing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Sufficiency Threshold</strong></strong>: Agents are considered to have sufficient wealth if
            their wealth is above a certain threshold. Agents below this Threshold will receive donations from
            altruistic agents.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Societal Influence</strong></strong>: Agents are influenced by the majority behaviour of
            their neighbours. An agent adopts the majority norm with a certain probability.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Altruistic Wealth Redistribution</strong></strong>: There is a donation pool where
            <strong><strong>altruistic</strong></strong> agents can donate a fixed proportion of their wealth. This
            donation pool is distributed equally among all agents whose wealth falls below a sufficiency threshold. This
            redistribution mechanism simulates social welfare programs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Employment Dynamics</strong></strong>: Agents have an 80% chance of being employed initially.
            Unemployed agents have a probability of finding a job, while employed agents have a probability of being
            laid off.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Norm Change Probability</strong></strong>: Agents have a probability of changing their norm
            to the majority norm of their neighbours. Agents also have a probability of changing their norms when they
            receive donations from altruistic agents.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Initial Wealth</strong></strong>: Each agent is initialized with a predefined amount of
            wealth. The distribution of this initial wealth can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Equal</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Unequal (exponential distribution)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Very Unequal (Pareto distribution)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Initial Proportion of Altruistic Agents</strong></strong>: A small percentage of agents are
            altruistic (minority) at the start of the model run.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><strong>Network Structure</strong></strong>: Two network structures are considered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Barabasi-Albert</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Erdos-Renyi</p>
            </li>
